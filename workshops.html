                    Design-based causal inference was born in the 1970s and 1980s at Princeton University's industrial labor group. You can trace its lineage through both scholarship, but maybe just as importantly, coauthoring and mentorship.  Albert Rees comes to the University and brings with him increasingly available microdata and an intense focus on quantitative research.  He advises Orley Ashenfelter, the legend and the GOAT, who goes and then comes back having worked on job trainings programs and in the mean time invented difference-in-differences.  He advised David Card, arguably the greatest labor economist of his generation and the 2021 recipient of the Nobel Prize in economics.  Together they would advise the late Bob LaLonde, author of a famous 1985 article in the AER showing that contemporary program evaluation methodologies which -- to put it lightly -- sucked.  Card would advise other luminaries like Josh Angrist (his co-recipient of the 2021 Nobel Prize and a key architect in the emerging design-based causal inference worldview).  Orley would hire the late, brilliant Alan Krueger, and out of this incredible soil would grow scholars like Phil Levine, Janet Currie, Jörn-Steffen Pischke and many many more. Angrist would go to Harvard where he would be Guido Imbens, the third recipient of the 2021 Nobel Prize, who would work with Don Rubin.  Angrist and Imbens would write classics in instrumental variables and the local average treatment effect all throughout the 1990s, changing the profession, and building more bricks to lay down a solid floor for empirical microeconomists to come.

                    But this design-based world view was met with opposition from the profession as other empirical micro approaches competed with.  So how did it come to dominate -- because clearly Princeton won the battle and the war, as we are all design-based today -- the practices and views of empirical microeconomists today?  They came and spread this worldview in two ways: through their compelling scholarship and through mentoring.

                    This mentoring was, in my opinion, an incredibly point way in which design-based causal inference spread like wildfire.  But because these men and  women were, in the end, applied empiricists, and less so econometricians with the exception of the brilliant Guido Imbens, the ideas followed placements, many if not most were placed in highly selective programs such as Berkeley, Harvard and MIT.  And when they went to state universities, they would go to selective ones.

                    But the point is simple -- it was slow to go into the econometrics textbooks that many of us depended on for our training when our own field courses in labor or health or public could not be traced back to Princeton.  

                    I wrote my book, Causal Inference: the Mixtape, and started Mixtape Sessions, my platform to democratize causal inference, because I believed and still believe that because design-based causal inference spread through applied microeconomists who taught field courses and not usually econometrics that it left many holes in the curriculums across the world in learning this methodology.  And because this methodology and worldview has become so dominant, that the training is spotty, even to this day, many economists and young people are still left without access to it. So I started Mixtape Sessions because I deeply want to play a role in the Invisible Hand's filling out of the missing parts.

                    Mixtape Sessions is my online education platform I created with the purpose to democratize causal inference by offering courses on causal inference related methodologies (including R, julia and workflow courses) at low prices for students, predocs, postdocs and residents of low and middle income countries ($50/persons) and $595 for everyone else.  Scheduled or previous workshops include a 5-day workshop on causal inference (taught by me), a 3-day workshop on difference-in-differences (taught by me), a 1-day workshop instrumental variables (taught by Peter Hull), and a 1-day workshop on difference-in-differences (taught by Jon Roth). Future planned courses (yet to be pinned down) include a course by Grant McDermott (University of Oregon) on workflow, R and version control, Rebecca Thornton (University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) on field experiments and survey design, Paul Hündermund (University of Copenhagen) on causal graphs and causal algorithms, Victor Chernozjukov (MIT) on machine learning and causal inference, and likely more.

                    <b>In person workshops</b>: But, for those who are interested in having me come visit your department, firm or agency to do a multi-day workshop on causal inference methodology, that too can be worked out. Planned and prior workshops have been at a range of universities and firms such as the Twitch, University of Copenhagen, London School of Economics, Facebook, Manifold, Papa Johns, Oxford University and many more. Please email Emmi Scott at emmi.scott@mixtape.consulting to arrange this.
