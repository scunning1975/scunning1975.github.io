                    I wrote my book, <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com">Causal Inference: the Mixtape</a>, and teach <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">online and in-person workshops</a> to "democratize causal inference" because I believed and still believe that causal inference is a crucially important topic and that everyone working with data should learn more about it.  But I also think it has been a somewhat siloed area -- siloed both within selected fields (like labor, health, development economics) but also academia (and economics in particular) more generally. Mixtape Sessions is my own personal effort to correct that by creating a bridge to this material who needs it and wants it through online and in-person workshops by me and other selected teachers.

                    <strong><a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a></strong><br>
                    There are two options for my workshops -- the online <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a> and the in-person workshops.  Mixtape Sessions is my online education platform I created with the purpose to democratize causal inference by offering courses on causal inference related methodologies (including R, julia and workflow courses) at low prices for students, predocs, postdocs and residents of low and middle income countries ($50/persons) and $595 for everyone else.  I teach two courses regularly on this platform: a 5-day course on causal inference and a 3-day course on difference-in-differences and if you bundle them, it's $90 for students, predocs, postdocs and residents of low and middle income countries and $995 for everyone else.  Here's some information about my workshops and other speakers planned in 2022.

                    <p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Causal Inference 4-day workshop</b><br>
                        This workshop is about 90% design-based causal inference and about 10% model based.  It covers the foundations of causality (i.e., counterfactuals), potential outcomes, causal graphs (i.e., Judea Pearl) and all the major designs. It includes regular programming exercises in R, python and Stata.  The goal is to teach students both the theory of causal inference as well as leave them with code that together instills confidence and competency in building on the course to do their own research in empirical social scientific research in industry, government, public policy and academic applications. <br>

                        <br>
                        
                        <b>Topics</b><br>    
                        1. Hidden curriculum on empirical workflow, pre-analysis principles of cleaning and preparation of data, and version control.   <br>
                        2. Foundations in design based causal inference (Card, Angrist and Imbens' worldview focusing the potential outcomes model primarily) and model based causal inference (Judea Pearl's causal graphs)<br>
                        3. Randomization, selection bias, and randomization inference<br>
                        4. Regression discontinuity<br>
                        5. Instrumental variables<br>
                        6. And if possible, matching and weighting<br>

                        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Difference-in-differences and synthetic control 4-day workshop</b><br>
                        This 4-day workshop covers a selective review of the more recent advances in DiD, focusing primarily on modeling when there are covariates and when there is differential timing, continuous treatments, as well as selective review or recent synthetic control. <br>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <b>Topics</b><br>
                        1. Potential outcomes review and identification without covariates<br>
                        2. Difference-in-differences calculation, the ATT, and parallel trends
                        3. Identification with covariates<br>
                        4. Bacon decomposition of twoway fixed effects with differential timing<br>
                        5. Aggregated group-time approaches to differential timing, including stacking<br>
                        6. Imputation methods<br>
                        7. Synthetic control<br></p>

                    <b>Mixtape Sessions</b><br>
                    In addition to my courses, <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a> also regularly invites top speakers to teach their own specialized workshops such as courses on instrumental variables and machine learning. 

                    <p></p>

                    You can sign up for <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a> by going to the website and selecting the course (and date) that you wish.  These sell out quickly, so I encourage you not to wait.  As I said, I use price discrimination to deliver steep discounts for students, predocs, postdocs and residents of middle income countries at $50 per person.  And if you are a resident of a low income country (<a href="https://g2lm-lic.iza.org/call-phase-iv/list-of-lic/">list here</a>), I offer 15 slots at $1 apiece. All others the price is $595 per person.  You can see some of the materials from earlier workshops <a href="https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions">here</a>.

                <p>
                    <b>In person workshops</b> <br>
                    But sometimes departments and firms may prefer that I come to them. It would allow their entire department of students and others to receive intense training on their turf. And that’s also great — I’ve done dozens of those around the world. Planned and prior workshops have been at a range of universities and firms such as the Twitch, University of Copenhagen, London School of Economics, Facebook, Manifold, Papa Johns, Oxford University and many more. These “in person workshops” can be worked out directly with my amazing assistant, <a href="mailto: emmi.scott@mixtape.consulting">Emmi Scott</a> (and no you can't have her).<br>
