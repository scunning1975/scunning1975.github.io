                    <b>Causal Inference workshops</b>
                    I wrote my book, <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com">Causal Inference: the Mixtape</a>, and teach <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">online and in-person workshops</a> to "democratize causal inference" because I believed and still believe that because design-based causal inference spread through applied microeconomists who taught field courses and not usually econometrics that it left many holes in the curriculums across the world in learning this methodology.  And because this methodology and worldview has become so dominant, that the training is spotty, even to this day, many economists and young people are still left without access to it. So I started Mixtape Sessions because I deeply want to play a role in the Invisible Hand's filling out of the missing parts.

                    <strong><a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a></strong>
                    There are two options for my workshops -- the online <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a> and the in-person workshops.  Mixtape Sessions is my online education platform I created with the purpose to democratize causal inference by offering courses on causal inference related methodologies (including R, julia and workflow courses) at low prices for students, predocs, postdocs and residents of low and middle income countries ($50/persons) and $595 for everyone else.  I teach two courses regularly on this platform: a 5-day course on causal inference and a 3-day course on difference-in-differences.  Causal Inference covers:

                    <p>
                        <b>Causal Inference</b><br>
                        1. Hidden curriculum on empirical workflow, pre-analysis principles of cleaning and preparation of data, and version control.   <br>
                        2. Foundations in design based causal inference (Card, Angrist and Imbens' worldview focusing the potential outcomes model primarily) and model based causal inference (Judea Pearl's causal graphs)<br>
                        3. Randomization, selection bias, and randomization inference<br>
                        4. Regression discontinuity<br>
                        5. Instrumental variables<br>
                        6. Difference-in-differences<br>
                        7. Synthetic control<br>
                        8. And if possible, matching and weighting<br>

                    </p>
                    
                    Difference-in-differences covers a selective review of the more recent advances in DiD focusing primarily on modeling when there are covariates and when there is differential timing, continuous treatments, and synthetic control
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Difference-in-differences</b><br>
                    1. Potential outcomes review and identification without covariates<br>
                    2. Identification with covariates<br>
                    3. Bacon decomposition of twoway fixed effects with differential timing<br>
                    4. Aggregated group-time approaches to differential timing, including stacking<br>
                    5. Imputation methods<br>
                    6. Synthetic controls, matrix completion with nuclear norm regularization, synthetic DiD, and augmented synthetic control<br>
                    
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    
                    In addition to my courses, Mixtape Sessions provides speakers who will also lead workshops on causal inference relevant procedures such a 1-day workshop instrumental variables taught by Peter Hull, a 1-day workshop on advanced difference-in-differences taught by Jon Roth. Future planned courses (yet to be pinned down) include a course by Grant McDermott (University of Oregon) on workflow, R and version control, Rebecca Thornton (University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) on field experiments and survey design, Paul HÃ¼ndermund (University of Copenhagen) on causal graphs and causal algorithms, Victor Chernozjukov (MIT) on machine learning and causal inference, and likely more.

                    <p></p>

                    You can sign up for <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a> by going to the website and selecting the course (and date) that you wish.  These sell out quickly, so I encourage you not to wait.  The pricing of these courses are focused on providing steep discounts for students, predocs, postdocs and residents of low and middle income countries at $50 per person.  All others the price is $595 per person.

                    <b>In person workshops</b> 
                    But sometimes, people may prefer an in-person workshop.  For those who are interested in having me come visit your department, firm or agency to do a multi-day workshop on causal inference methodology, that too can be worked out. Planned and prior workshops have been at a range of universities and firms such as the Twitch, University of Copenhagen, London School of Economics, Facebook, Manifold, Papa Johns, Oxford University and many more. Please email Emmi Scott at emmi.scott@mixtape.consulting to arrange this.
