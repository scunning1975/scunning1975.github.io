                    I wrote my book, <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com">Causal Inference: the Mixtape</a>, and teach <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">online and in-person workshops</a> to "democratize causal inference" because I believed and still believe that causal inference is a crucially important topic and that everyone working with data should learn more about it.  But that doesn't exactly get to the heart of why I hold these workshops.  The spread of causal inference in economics fused with the Princeton Industrial Relations Section in the 1970s and 1980s which meant that by the time the formal potential outcomes material descending from the experimental design tradition through Don Rubin became involved, it had already settled on labor economics as its primary expression.  The historic spread of causal inference, therefore, was wrapped inside a natural experiment framework as opposed to a formalized econometrics framework, which may explain why it had for so long been far more likely that you learned this in your field courses (e.g., labor economics, development economics) than in econometrics classes or canonical econometrics textbooks.  But this has implications for all of us because these micro field courses are very diverse. There are many rivers that lead into labor economics, not just those that date back to the Princeton Industrial Relations Section, which meant that as you moved further down departmental rankings, one might very well not even be exposed to this material unless one's professors could be traced back to the source.  This is how paradigms work though -- they are as much sociological phenomena as they are scientific beliefs.  
                    
                    So, I started all of my various endeavors to popularize causal inference (or what I sometimes just call my "Mixtape stuff") to both help people learn it, but also to help solve this problem where the ideas select on particular people, particular departments, particular fields and in particular places.  Given the importance of the ideas, they are too important to be siloed among elite universities in the United States. So the Mixtape stuff is meant to help target that problem and hopefully reduce the inequities by lowering the cost to learning it through a variety of efforts such as my book, my substack writings, my podcast interviews, and my workshops.

                    <b>Personalized workshops</b> <br>
                    Sometimes departments, agencies and firms may prefer that I come to them, either in person or over zoom.  I’ve done dozens of those around the world for all types -- economics departments, non-economics departments, academia, non-academic agencies, non-profits and for profit organizations.  You name it, I think I've done a workshop for that type of group. Prior workshops have been at a range of universities and firms like eBay, Twitch, University of Copenhagen, London School of Economics, Facebook, Manifold, Papa Johns, Oxford University and many more. These "personalized workshops” can be worked out directly by emailing me.  I can can share with you previous syllabi and course descriptions as well as talk about my schedule and pricing.<br>

                    <strong><a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a></strong><br>
                   <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a> is a platform that attempts to democratize causal inference by offering online and low-priced workshops on causal inference related methodologies.  These are taught by myself, but also others by invitation, such as Peter Hull at Brown, Jon Roth at Brown, Alberto Abadie at MIT, Rocio Titunik at Princeton, Brigham Frandsen at BYU and others.  These workshops contain coding exercises, slides, and simulations.  They also provide recordings so that a registered guest can go back and study this material at their own pace.  But, these recordings are not for sale -- they belong only to the guests. All others must pay full price at $595 a workshop.  Those individuals who pay full price, though, are welcome to request a one-on-one meeting with me for "office hours" if they feel that they need someone to talk to about their projects. 
                   
                   Because of variation in ability to pay, and given the mission of Mixtape Sessions is to reduce the barriers to learning this material globally, I use steep pricing discounts depending on one's current country of residence and career stage.  If you are <a href="https://g2lm-lic.iza.org/call-phase-iv/list-of-lic/">a resident of one of these listed low income countries</a> or India, then the price of the workshop is $1 USD. If you are, though, otherwise a student, predocs, postdocs, a resident of middle income countries or unemployed at the moment, then you qualify for a $50 USD price. If you are a non-tenure track lecturer or on a "high teaching load" at a college or university regardless of tenure status, then you qualify for a $95 discount.
