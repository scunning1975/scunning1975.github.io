                    I wrote my book, <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com">Causal Inference: the Mixtape</a>, and teach <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">online and in-person workshops</a> to "democratize causal inference" because I believed and still believe that causal inference is a crucially important topic and that everyone working with data should learn more about it.  But that doesn't exactly get to the heart of why I hold these workshops.  I do all this popularizing of accessible causal inference because of a firm belief that the form of causal inference that came to dominate economics, and which has also bled into influence throughout other fields too, came from a fusion between Princeton Industrial Relations Section faculty and students in the 1970s and 1980s as well as statisticians and econometricians at Harvard in the 1970s through the 1990s.  A picture of this fusion is shown below, but I have also written at length about it on <a href="https://causalinf.substack.com/s/history-of-economics">my substack in various places here</a>. But this image more or less captures what I mean.

                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-5 research-figure">
                        <img src="research-images/design_traditions.jpeg" style="width: 100%;"/>
                    </div>

                    While this is intellectually interesting, this flow chart is important to me for a different reason.  There is no one "causal inference". There are only paradigms in causal inference, and the one I think many typically think of as "the causal inference" is the one they vaguely associate with this graph.  That is, they think of causal inference as natural experiments and the Rubin causal model.  

                    But so what?  What am I trying to say with this graphic?  What I am trying to say with this graphic is that because this causal inference became very influential, and this causal inference is narrowly connected to a group of labor economists at Princeton's Industrial Relations Section in the 1970s and 1980s, and a Harvard statistician named Don Rubin and his prolific writings in the 1970s through the 1990s, it took on a particular flavor that largely skipped over econometrics.  You could find some of this material in canonical textbooks, but usually only at the back and often only cursory skethces.

                    This matters in my mind.  And it matters because insofar as this causal inference became the dominant paradigm, and this causal inference skipped our normal channels of training (e.g., textbooks), it meant that you typically only historically learned it if you happened to be at a particular school in a particular department in a particular American city whose particular microeconomics field class was taught by a particular professor who descended along a geneological tree that connected back to this source. 

                    But our scientific fields are diverse.  Not all labor economists come from Princeton or MIT!  It is a rich tradition.  And not all of the social sciences are economics!  Not all quantitative methodologies are design-based.  And yet this is material that many people want to learn for their own personal reasons.  This is a long way of saying that there has been and remains inequities globally across fields and department rankings in learning the material in this picture.  And so, all of my "Mixtape Stuff" -- the book, the substack, the podcast interviews, the workshops -- is about trying to push at the extensive margin by making as much of this as accessible for as many people as I can.

                    Let me now tell you a little about, then, the workshops which is one of the main ways, apart from my book, that people have a chance to learn this material.
                    
    


                <p>
                    <strong><a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a></strong><br>
                   The main way I try to address tehse inequities is through my <a href="https://www.mixtapesessions.io">Mixtape Sessions</a> platform.  Mixtape Sessions is my way to try and democratize causal inference by offering online and low-priced workshops on causal inference related methodologies.  These are taught by myself, but also others by invitation, such as Peter Hull at Brown, Jon Roth at Brown, Alberto Abadie at MIT, Rocio Titunik at Princeton, Brigham Frandsen at BYU and others.  These workshops contain coding exercises, slides, and simulations.  They also provide recordings so that a registered guest can go back and study this material at their own pace.  But, these recordings are not for sale -- they belong only to the guests. All others must pay full price at $595 a workshop.  Those individuals who pay full price, though, are welcome to request a one-on-one meeting with me for "office hours" if they feel that they need someone to talk to about their projects. 
                   
                   Because of variation in ability to pay, and given the mission of Mixtape Sessions is to reduce the barriers to learning this material globally, I use steep pricing discounts depending on one's current country of residence and career stage.  If you are <a href="https://g2lm-lic.iza.org/call-phase-iv/list-of-lic/">a resident of one of these listed low income countries</a> or India, then the price of the workshop is $1 USD. If you are, though, otherwise a student, predocs, postdocs, a resident of middle income countries or unemployed at the moment, then you qualify for a $50 USD price. If you are a non-tenure track lecturer or on a "high teaching load" at a college or university regardless of tenure status, then you qualify for a $95 discount.

                    <b>Personalized workshops (in person or over Zoom)</b> <br>
                    Sometimes departments, agencies and firms may prefer that I come to them, either in person or over zoom.  I’ve done dozens of those around the world for all types -- economics departments, non-economics departments, academia, non-academic agencies, non-profits and for profit organizations.  You name it, I think I've done a workshop for that type of group. Prior workshops have been at a range of universities and firms like eBay, Twitch, University of Copenhagen, London School of Economics, Facebook, Manifold, Papa Johns, Oxford University and many more. These "personalized workshops” can be worked out directly by emailing me.  I can can share with you previous syllabi and course descriptions as well as talk about my schedule and pricing.<br>
