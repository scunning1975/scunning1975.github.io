        <h3>Mixtape Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Mixtape Sessions</strong> is an international teaching initiative created by Scott Cunningham to democratize access to causal inference. It is the home of accessible, hands-on, and equity-conscious workshops taught by leading economists and researchers working at the frontier of applied econometrics and design-based inference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2021, we’ve hosted over 50 workshops reaching more than 8,000 participants. Our core series—<em>The Classics</em>—follows the structure of Scott’s book <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com">Causal Inference: The Mixtape</a>. These workshops are open to students, practitioners, and researchers of all levels, and emphasize comprehension, competency, and confidence through hands-on coding labs and interactive apps.
        </p>
