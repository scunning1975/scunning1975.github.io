<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Example: Identifying Price Elasticity of Demand</h2>
<p>One of the cornerstones of scientific methodologies is empirical analysis.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> By empirical analysis, I mean the use of data to test a theory or to estimate a relationship between variables. The first step in conducting an empirical economic analysis is the careful formulation of the question we would like to answer. In some cases, we would like to develop and test a formal economic model that describes mathematically a certain relationship, behavior, or process of interest. Those models are valuable insofar as they both describe the phenomena of interest and make falsifiable (testable) predictions. A prediction is falsifiable insofar as we can evaluate, and potentially reject, the prediction with data.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A model is the framework with which we describe the relationships we are interested in, the intuition for our results, and the hypotheses we would like to test.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>After we have specified a model, we turn it into what is called an econometric model, which can be estimated directly with data. One clear issue we immediately face is regarding the functional form of the model, or how to describe the relationships of the variables we are interested in through an equation. Another important issue is how we will deal with variables that cannot be directly or reasonably observed by the researcher, or that cannot be measured very well, but which play an important role in our model.</p>
<p>A generically important contribution to our understanding of causal inference is the notion of comparative statics. Comparative statics are theoretical descriptions of causal effects contained within the model. These kinds of comparative statics are always based on the idea of <em>ceteris paribus</em>—or “all else constant.” When we are trying to describe the causal effect of some intervention, for instance, we are always assuming that the other relevant variables in the model are not changing. If they were changing, then they would be correlated with the variable of interest and it would confound our estimation.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>To illustrate this idea, let’s begin with a basic economic model: supply and demand equilibrium and the problems it creates for estimating the price elasticity of demand. Policy-makers and business managers have a natural interest in learning the price elasticity of demand because knowing it enables firms to maximize profits and governments to choose optimal taxes, and whether to restrict quantity altogether <span class="citation">(Becker, Grossman, and Murphy <a href="#ref-Becker2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. But the problem is that we do not observe demand curves, because demand curves are theoretical objects. More specifically, a demand curve is a collection of paired potential outcomes of price and quantity. We observe <em>price and quantity equilibrium values</em>, not the potential price and potential quantities along the entire demand curve. Only by tracing out the potential outcomes along a demand curve can we calculate the elasticity.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>To see this, consider this graphic from Philip Wright’s Appendix B <span class="citation">(Wright <a href="#ref-Wright1928" role="doc-biblioref">1928</a>)</span>, which we’ll discuss in greater detail later (Figure <a href="example-identifying-price-elasticity-of-demand.html#fig:sd">1.2</a>). The price elasticity of demand is the ratio of percentage changes in quantity to price <em>for a single demand curve</em>. Yet, when there are shifts in supply and demand, a sequence of quantity and price pairs emerges in history that reflect neither the demand curve nor the supply curve. In fact, connecting the points does not reflect any meaningful or useful object.</p>
<p>The price elasticity of demand is the solution to the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\epsilon = \frac{\partial \log Q}{\partial \log P}
\]</span></p>
<p>But in this example, the change in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is <em>exogenous</em>. For instance, it holds supply fixed, the prices of other goods fixed, income fixed, preferences fixed, input costs fixed, and so on. In order to estimate the price elasticity of demand, we need changes in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that are completely and utterly independent of the otherwise normal determinants of supply and the other determinants of demand. Otherwise we get shifts in either supply or demand, which creates new pairs of data for which any correlation between <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> will not be a measure of the elasticity of demand.</p>
<p>The problem is that the elasticity is an important object, and we need to know it, and therefore we need to solve this problem. So given this theoretical object, we must write out an econometric model as a starting point. One possible example of an econometric model would be a linear demand function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\log Q_d = \alpha+\delta \log P+\gamma X + u
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the intercept, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the elasticity of demand, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a matrix of factors that determine demand like the prices of other goods or income, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the coefficient on the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the error term.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Foreshadowing the content of this mixtape, we need two things to estimate price elasticity of demand. First, we need numerous rows of data on price and quantity. Second, we need for the variation in price in our imaginary data set to be independent of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. We call this kind of independence <em>exogeneity</em>. Without both, we cannot recover the price elasticity of demand, and therefore any decision that requires that information will be based on stabs in the dark.</p>

<li id="fn8"><p>One of the things implied by <em>ceteris paribus</em> that comes up repeatedly in this book is the idea of covariate balance. If we say that everything is the same except for the movement of one variable, then everything is the same on both sides of that variable’s changing value. Thus, when we invoke <em>ceteris paribus</em>, we are implicitly invoking covariate balance—both the observable and the unobservable covariates.<a href="example-identifying-price-elasticity-of-demand.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
