<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What Is Causal Inference?</h2>
<p>My first job out of graduate school was as an assistant professor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where I still work and live today. I was restless the second I got there. I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality. I had been orbiting that theory ever since seeing that difference-in-differences table in <span class="citation">Levine (<a href="#ref-Levine2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>. But I needed more. So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new—I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn’t know.</p>
<p>I named the course Causal Inference and Research Design and taught it for the first time to Baylor master’s students in 2010. At the time, I couldn’t really find an example of the sort of class I was looking for, so I cobbled together a patchwork of ideas from several disciplines and authors, like labor economics, public economics, sociology, political science, epidemiology, and statistics. You name it. My class wasn’t a pure econometrics course; rather, it was an applied empirical class that taught a variety of contemporary research designs, such as difference-in-differences, and it was filled with empirical replications and readings, all of which were built on the robust theory of causality found in Donald Rubin’s work as well as the work of Judea Pearl. This book and that class are in fact very similar to one another.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>So how would I define causal inference? Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest. It is not a new field; humans have been obsessing over causality since antiquity. But what is new is the progress we believe we’ve made in estimating causal effects both inside and outside the laboratory. Some date the beginning of this new, modern causal inference to <span class="citation">Fisher (<a href="#ref-Fisher1935" role="doc-biblioref">1935</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Haavelmo (<a href="#ref-Haavelmo1943" role="doc-biblioref">1943</a>)</span>, or <span class="citation">Rubin (<a href="#ref-Rubin1974" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span>. Some connect it to the work of early pioneers like John Snow. We should give a lot of credit to numerous highly creative labor economists from the late 1970s to late 1990s whose ambitious research agendas created a revolution in economics that continues to this day. You could even make an argument that we owe it to the Cowles Commission, Philip and Sewall Wright, and the computer scientist Judea Pearl.</p>
<p>But however you date its emergence, causal inference has now matured into a distinct field, and not surprisingly, you’re starting to see more and more treatments of it as such. It’s sometimes reviewed in a lengthy chapter on “program evaluation” in econometrics textbooks <span class="citation">(Wooldridge <a href="#ref-Wooldridge2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, or even given entire book-length treatments. To name just a few textbooks in the growing area, there’s <span class="citation">Angrist and Pischke (<a href="#ref-Angrist2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Morgan and Winship (<a href="#ref-Morgan2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Imbens and Rubin (<a href="#ref-Imbens2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, and probably a half dozen others, not to mention numerous, lengthy treatments of specific strategies, such as those found in <span class="citation">Angrist and Krueger (<a href="#ref-Angrist2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Imbens and Lemieux (<a href="#ref-Imbens2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. The market is quietly adding books and articles about identifying causal effects with data all the time.</p>
<p>So why does <em>Causal Inference: The Mixtape</em> exist? Well, to put it bluntly, a readable introductory book with programming examples, data, and detailed exposition didn’t exist until this one. My book is an effort to fill that hole, because I believe what researchers really need is a guide that takes them from knowing almost nothing about causal inference to a place of competency. Competency in the sense that they are conversant and literate about what designs can and cannot do. Competency in the sense that they can take data, write code and, using theoretical and contextual knowledge, implement a reasonable design in one of their own projects. If this book helps someone do that, then this book will have had value, and that is all I can and should hope for.</p>
<p>But what books out there do I like? Which ones have inspired this book? And why don’t I just keep using them? For my classes, I mainly relied on <span class="citation">Morgan and Winship (<a href="#ref-Morgan2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Angrist and Pischke (<a href="#ref-Angrist2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, as well as a library of theoretical and empirical articles. These books are in my opinion definitive classics. But they didn’t satisfy my needs, and as a result, I was constantly jumping between material. Other books were awesome but not quite right for me either. <span class="citation">Imbens and Rubin (<a href="#ref-Imbens2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> cover the potential outcomes model, experimental design, and matching and instrumental variables, but not directed acyclic graphical models (DAGs), regression discontinuity, panel data, or synthetic control. <span class="citation">Morgan and Winship (<a href="#ref-Morgan2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> cover DAGs, the potential outcomes model, and instrumental variables, but have too light a touch on regression discontinuity and panel data for my tastes. They also don’t cover synthetic control, which has been called the most important innovation in causal inference of the last 15 years by <span class="citation">Athey and Imbens (<a href="#ref-Athey2017c" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Angrist and Pischke (<a href="#ref-Angrist2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> is very close to what I need but does not include anything on synthetic control or on the graphical models that I find so critically useful. But maybe most importantly, <span class="citation">Imbens and Rubin (<a href="#ref-Imbens2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Angrist and Pischke (<a href="#ref-Angrist2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Morgan and Winship (<a href="#ref-Morgan2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> do not provide <em>any</em> practical programming guidance, and I believe it is in replication and coding that we gain knowledge in these areas.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>This book was written with a few different people in mind. It was written first and foremost for <em>practitioners</em>, which is why it includes easy-to-download data sets and programs. It’s why I have made several efforts to review papers as well as replicate the models as much as possible. I want readers to understand this field, but as important, I want them to feel empowered so that they can use these tools to answer their own research questions.</p>
<p>Another person I have in mind is the experienced social scientist who wants to retool. Maybe these are people with more of a theoretical bent or background, or maybe they’re people who simply have some holes in their human capital. This book, I hope, can help guide them through the modern theories of causality so common in the social sciences, as well as provide a calculus in directed acyclic graphical models that can help connect their knowledge of theory with estimation. The DAGs in particular are valuable for this group, I think.</p>
<p>A third group that I’m focusing on is the nonacademic person in industry, media, think tanks, and the like. Increasingly, knowledge about causal inference is expected throughout the professional world. It is no longer simply something that academics sit around and debate. It is crucial knowledge for making business decisions as well as for interpreting policy.</p>
<p>Finally, this book is written for people very early in their careers, be they undergraduates, graduate students, or newly minted PhDs. My hope is that this book can give them a jump start so that they don’t have to meander, like many of us did, through a somewhat labyrinthine path to these methods.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>I decided to write this book for one simple reason: I didn’t feel that the market had provided the book that I needed for my students. So I wrote this book for my students and me so that we’d all be on the same page. This book is my best effort to explain causal inference to myself. I felt that if I could explain causal inference to myself, then I would be able to explain it to others too. Not thinking the book would have much value outside of my class, I posted it to my website and told people about it on Twitter.
