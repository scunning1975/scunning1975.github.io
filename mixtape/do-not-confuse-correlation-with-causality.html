<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Do Not Confuse Correlation with Causality</h2>
<p>It is very common these days to hear someone say “correlation does not mean causality.” Part of the purpose of this book is to help readers be able to understand exactly why correlations, particularly in observational data, are unlikely to be reflective of a causal relationship. When the rooster crows, the sun soon after rises, but we know the rooster didn’t cause the sun to rise. Had the rooster been eaten by the farmer’s cat, the sun still would have risen. Yet so often people make this kind of mistake when naively interpreting simple correlations.</p>

<p>But weirdly enough, sometimes there are causal relationships between two things and yet <em>no observable correlation</em>. Now that is definitely strange. How can one thing cause another thing without any discernible correlation between the two things? Consider this example, which is illustrated in Figure <a href="do-not-confuse-correlation-with-causality.html#fig:scottboat">1.1</a>. A sailor is sailing her boat across the lake on a windy day. As the wind blows, she counters by turning the rudder in such a way so as to exactly offset the force of the wind. Back and forth she moves the rudder, yet the boat follows a straight line across the lake. A kindhearted yet naive person with no knowledge of wind or boats might look at this woman and say, “Someone get this sailor a new rudder! Hers is broken!” He thinks this because he cannot see any relationship between the movement of the rudder and the direction of the boat.</p>
<p>But does the fact that he cannot see the relationship mean there isn’t one? Just because there is no observable relationship does not mean there is no causal one. Imagine that instead of perfectly countering the wind by turning the rudder, she had instead flipped a coin—heads she turns the rudder left, tails she turns the rudder right. What do you think this man would have seen if she was sailing her boat according to coin flips? If she <em>randomly</em> moved the rudder on a windy day, then he would see a sailor zigzagging across the lake. Why would he see the relationship if the movement were randomized but not be able to see it otherwise? Because the sailor is <em>endogenously</em> moving the rudder in response to the unobserved wind. And as such, the relationship between the rudder and the boat’s direction is canceled—even though there is a causal relationship between the two.</p>
<p>This sounds like a silly example, but in fact there are more serious versions of it. Consider a central bank reading tea leaves to discern when a recessionary wave is forming. Seeing evidence that a recession is emerging, the bank enters into open-market operations, buying bonds and pumping liquidity into the economy. Insofar as these actions are done optimally, these open-market operations will show no relationship whatsoever with actual output. In fact, in the ideal, banks may engage in aggressive trading in order to stop a recession, and we would be unable to see any evidence that it was working <em>even though it was</em>!</p>
<p>Human beings engaging in optimal behavior are the main reason correlations almost never reveal causal relationships, because rarely are human beings acting randomly. And as we will see, it is the presence of randomness that is crucial for identifying causal effect.</p>
