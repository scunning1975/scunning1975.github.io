<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>This book is an introduction to research designs that can recover causal effects. But just as importantly, it provides you with hands-on practice to implement these designs. Implementing these designs means writing code in some type of software. I have chosen to illustrate these designs using two popular software languages: Stata (most commonly used by economists) and R (most commonly used by everyone else).</p>
<p>The book contains numerous empirical exercises illustrated in the Stata and R programs. These exercises are either simulations (which don’t need external data) or exercises requiring external data. The data needed for the latter have been made available to you at Github. The Stata examples will download files usually at the start of the program using the following command: use <a href="https://github.com/scunning1975/mixtape/raw/master/DATAFILENAME.DTA" class="uri">https://github.com/scunning1975/mixtape/raw/master/DATAFILENAME.DTA</a>, where DATAFILENAME.DTA is the name of a particular data set.</p>
<p>For R users, it is a somewhat different process to load data into memory. In an effort to organize and clean the code, my students Hugo Sant’Anna and Terry Tsai created a function to simplify the data download process. This is partly based on a library called haven, which is a package for reading data files. It is secondly based on a set of commands that create a function that will then download the data directly from Github.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Some readers may not be familiar with either Stata or R but nonetheless wish to follow along. I encourage you to use this opportunity to invest in learning one or both of these languages. It is beyond the scope of this book to provide an introduction to these languages, but fortunately, there are numerous resources online. For instance, Christopher Baum has written an excellent introduction to Stata at <a href="https://fmwww.bc.edu/GStat/docs/StataIntro.pdf" class="uri">https://fmwww.bc.edu/GStat/docs/StataIntro.pdf</a>. Stata is popular among microeconomists, and given the amount of coauthoring involved in modern economic research, an argument could be made for investing in it solely for its ability to solve basic coordination problems between you and potential coauthors. But a downside to Stata is that it is proprietary and must be purchased. And for some people, that may simply be too big of a barrier—especially for anyone simply wanting to follow along with the book. R on the other hand is open-source and free. Tutorials on Basic R can be found at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf</a>, and an introduction to Tidyverse (which is used throughout the R programming) can be found at <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz" class="uri">https://r4ds.had.co.nz</a>. Using this time to learn R would likely be well worth your time.</p>
<p>Perhaps you already know R and want to learn Stata. Or perhaps you know Stata and want to learn R. Then this book may be helpful because of the way in which both sets of code are put in sequence to accomplish the same basic tasks. But, with that said, in many situations, although I have tried my best to reconcile results from Stata and R, I was not always able to do so. Ultimately, Stata and R are different programming languages that sometimes yield different results because of different optimization procedures or simply because the programs are built slightly differently. This has been discussed occasionally in articles in which authors attempt to better understand what accounts for the differing results. I was not always able to fully reconcile different results, and so I offer the two programs as simply alternative approaches. You are ultimately responsible for anything you do on your own using either language for your research. I leave it to you ultimately to understand the method and estimating procedure contained within a given software and package.</p>
<p>In conclusion, simply finding an association between two variables might be suggestive of a causal effect, but it also might not. Correlation doesn’t mean causation unless key assumptions hold. Before we start digging into the causal methodologies themselves, though, I need to lay down a foundation in statistics and regression modeling. Buckle up! This is going to be fun.</p>
